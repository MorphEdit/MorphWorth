# MorphWorth - Main Configuration
#
# This plugin displays item worth/value directly in item lore.
# Worth calculation includes:
#   - Base item price (from items: section in worth.yml)
#   - Enchantment bonuses (from enchantments: section in worth.yml)
#   - Stack quantity (automatically multiplied)
#
# update-interval-ticks:
#   How often the plugin refreshes item lore in player inventories.
#   20 ticks = 1 second. Example: 40 = 2 seconds, 100 = 5 seconds.
#   Lower values = more CPU usage but faster updates.
#   Higher values = less lag but slower lore refresh.
#
# lore-format:
#   The final line that will be added to the item's lore.
#   Placeholder: %price% = the calculated worth value.
#   Supports color codes using & (e.g., &a = green, &c = red).
#
# round-decimals:
#   How many decimal places to show for prices.
#   0 = no decimals (integer only, e.g., "100")
#   2 = two decimals (e.g., "100.50")
#
# lore-prefix:
#   The text prefix used to identify worth lines in lore.
#   Used internally to detect and remove old worth lines when updating.
#   Should match the beginning of your lore-format (without colors).
